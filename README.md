# Dynamic Weather App 

A dynamic weather application built with Javascript, React, Vite, and TailwindCSS, luxon, react icons, and react-toastify, HTML, and CSS.

This project fetches a clean and user-friendly interface and fetches weather data from an external API and displays real-time weather information. 

It displays the temprature, max, min, humidity, real feel, sunrise, sunset, hourly, and daily forecast, as well as the local time. It does this based on a current-location based search as well as a text box for searching for a city as well.
